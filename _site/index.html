			<p class="quote">University Courtyard has been a great place for us to start our lives. We have been here for two years and loved every minute. The apartments look great, and it is so nice being right across the street from campus. It's hard not to appreciate never having to fight for a good parking spot, and racing to class on time. The UC has been good for my wife and I, and we couldn't have imagined a better place to make so many friends that are at the same stage of life as us.</p>
